# Mongo Schema Validator

To start the app, run `npm install` then `npm start`

Once the app is running, you may upload your data and schema files. Alternatively,
there are buttons to load up the Nobel Prize data files that were provided.

Once files are loaded, schema violations with explanations will be highlighted in red and
can be edited to fix the violations.
